  * Becoming Man Movement
    * BECOMING MAN is a movement of God, birthed in the heart of Pastor IV Marsh. It is centered around returning men to their proper purpose on the earth; something that is so needed in our culture today. You don't have to look very far back into the annuals of American history to see that honorable men are disappearing before our very eyes. Honorable men who demonstrated true masculinity. Men who were a man's man, a man who not only demonstrates the physical qualities of ruggedness but who also possess mental toughness and emotional strength. A man who says what he means and means what he says. A man who recognizes the importance of honesty. A man of noble principle. A man without covetousness. A man who cannot be bribed or bullied. A man committed to manly virtues. A man who is the head of his home and knows how to control and discipline his children. A man who loves justice but also knows tenderness and mercy. A man who fears God and shows reverence for that which is sacred. A man who knows the difference between the rule of law and the lust for power. On the whole, our society today has little tolerance for such men. Even in our churches, masculinity is dying. BECOMING MAN seeks to reverse the current trend in our culture as we take men on a journey of self-discovery and self-mastery.
    * The BECOMING MAN Level Requirements are designed to guide men along the path of transformation into a mature son of God. At each level, there are requirements intended to display the attributes of Christ: Prophet, Priest, King, and Warrior. While one could certainly progress mechanically through the levels with no heart change, this is not the intent. Our deepest desire is that we all be transformed into the likeness of Jesus. 
* Beliefs
  * Mission Statement
    * BECOMING MAN IS A MOVEMENT CENTERED AROUND RETURNING HONOR TO MANHOOD BY MEN LEARNING TO BE PROPHET, PRIEST, KING, AND WARRIOR
  * Vision Statement
    * BECOMING MAN is committed to partner with local organizations and churches to change the hearts of men in order to change the world.  If you change a man you change a family.  If you change a family you change a community.  If you change a community you change a state.  If you change a state you change a country.  If you change a country you change the world - one man at a time.
  * Statement of Belief
    * We hold to the basic doctrines of biblical faith.
    * We believe the Bible to be the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God.
    * We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory.
    * We believe that the salvation of lost and sinful people is accomplished by grace alone through faith in Jesus Christ alone, by the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit.
    * We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a Godly life.
    * We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost, those who are saved to the resurrection of life and those who are lost to the resurrection of damnation.
  * Manhood
    * We believe that the Bible teaches that men are foundational. As go the men, so go the marriages, families, churches, communities and the culture.
    * God created men and women equal but not the same. He bestowed upon men unique roles of Prophet, Priest, King, and Warrior to teach God's Word to their wives, families, and friends, to serve their families, God's people and church, to provide for their families and churches and to protect their marriages, families and churches. However, we live in the first generation in history that's confused about what it means to be a man. There's a fatherlessness crisis today because there's a crisis in manhood.
    * Building a tribe of men, calling them out and up to the high, noble masculinity only found in Christ Jesus, and discipling in the gospel are the biggest challenges the church faces today. Jesus Christ is the ultimate Prophet, Priest, King, and Warrior who rescued us from sin and death, redeemed our fallen masculinity and set us truly free. Our hope is built on Him and Him alone.
  * Commitment
    * Rationale
      * We have been moved in our purpose by the following contemporary developments which we observe with deep concern:
        * The widespread uncertainty and confusion in our culture regarding the complementary differences between masculinity and femininity
        * The tragic effects of this confusion in unraveling the fabric of marriage woven by God out of the beautiful and diverse strands of manhood and womanhood
        * The increasing promotion given to feminist egalitarianism with accompanying distortions or neglect of the glad harmony portrayed in Scripture between the loving, humble leadership of redeemed husbands and the intelligent, willing support of that leadership by redeemed wives
        * The growing claims of legitimacy for sexual relationships which have Biblically and historically been considered illicit or perverse, and the increase in pornographic portrayal of human sexuality
        * The upsurge of physical and emotional abuse in the family
    * Affirmations
      * Based on our understanding of Biblical teachings, we affirm the following:
        * Both Adam and Eve were created in God's image, equal before God as persons and distinct in their manhood and womanhood - (Gen 1:26-27, 2:18).
        * Distinctions in masculine and feminine roles are ordained by God as part of the created order, and should find an echo in every human heart - (Gen 2:18, 21-24; 1 Cor 11:7-9; 1 Tim 2:12-14).
        * Adam's headship in marriage was established by God before the Fall, and was not a result of sin - (Gen 2:16-18, 21-24, 3:1-13; 1 Cor 11:7-9).
        * The Fall introduced distortions into the relationships between men and women - (Gen 3:1-7, 12, 16).
          * In the home, the husband's loving, humble headship tends to be replaced by domination or passivity; the wife's intelligent willing submission tends to be replaced by usurpation or servility.
          * In the church, sin inclines men toward a worldly love of power or an abdication of spiritual responsibility, and inclines women to resist limitations on their roles or to neglect the use of their gifts in appropriate ministries.
        * The Old Testament, as well as the New Testament, manifests the equally high value and dignity which God attached to the roles of both men and women (Gen 1:26-27, 2:18; Gal 3:28). Both Old and New Testaments also affirm the principle of male headship in the family and in the covenant community (Gen 2:18; Eph 5:21-33; Col 3:18-19; 1 Tim 2:11-15).
        * Redemption in Christ aims at removing the distortions introduced by the curse. In the family, husbands should forsake harsh or selfish leadership and grow in love and care for their wives; wives should forsake resistance to their husbands' authority and grow in willing, joyful submission to their husbands' leadership (Eph 5:21-33; Col 3:18-19; Tit 2:3-5; 1 Pet 3:1-7).
        * In all of life Christ is the supreme authority and guide for men and women, so that no earthly submission-domestic, religious, or civil-ever implies a mandate to follow a human authority into sin (Dan 3:10-18; Acts 4:19-20, 5:27-29; 1 Pet 3:1-2).
        * We are convinced that a denial or neglect of these principles will lead to increasingly destructive consequences in our families, our churches, and the culture at large.

* Why manhood matters section
  * There are 113,000,000 men in America over the age of 15. 69,000,000 of these men make no profession of faith in Christ. 90 million men are not involved in any kind of discipleship, with only 6 million men are involved in discipleship (1 out of every 18 men)
  * More than 90 percent of American men believe in God, and 5 out of 6 calls themselves Christians, but only 2 out of 6 attend church on a given Sunday. The typical U.S. Congregation draws an adult crowd that's 61% female, 39% male. This gender gap shows up in all age categories. The average man accepts the reality of Jesus Christ, but fails to see any value in going to church. Churches overseas report gender gaps of up to 9 women for every adult man in attendance. 
  * On any given Sunday, there are 13 million more adult women than men in America's churches. This Sunday almost 25 percent of married, churchgoing women will worship without their husbands. Midweek activities often draw 70 to 80 percent female participants. The majority of church employees are women (except for ordained clergy, who are overwhelmingly male).  75% of volunteers are women (one mainline pastor said it was 99% in his church). 
  * In America, fewer than 10% of U.S. churches are able to establish or maintain a vibrant men's ministry, with fewer than 1% of churchgoing men participating in any sort of ongoing men's ministry program. 4 out of 5 students in evangelical churches will drop out of church by their senior year in high school. Over 70 percent of the boys who are being raised in church will abandon it during their teens and twenties. Many of these boys will never return.
  * Christian universities are becoming convents. The typical Christian college in the U.S. enrolls almost 2 women for every 1 man, with the average ratio of men to women in Christian colleges at about 1 male to every 3 females. 
  * Fatherhood Matters
    * 33% of the 72 million children in America will go to bed without their biological father in the home. Fatherless children are five times as likely to live in poverty, repeat a grade, and have emotional problems. 93% of all people incarcerated are men and 85% of them have no father figure.
    * 3.5% family gets saved if the child is saved first.
    * 17% family gets saved if the mother is saved first.
    * 93% family gets saved if the father is saved first.
    * When a mother comes to Christ, her family will join her at church only 17% of the time; but when a father comes to Christ, his family joins him 93% of the time. 95% of men who attend a conference make a life-changing decision. 60% get connected to a small group. 25% make a first decision for Christ.
  * Men in the Church
    * For every 10 Men in the church
      * 9 will have kids who leave the church
      * 8 will not find their jobs satisfying
      * 6 will pay the monthly minimum on their credit cards
      * 5 will have major problems with pornography
      * 4 will get divorced affecting 1,000,000 children per year
    * As many as 70% of men have actively sought out pornography this year. This year as many Christians will divorce as non-Christians.

2. **Profile Modal**:
   ```vue
   <div class="fixed inset-0 z-50 overflow-y-auto">
     <div class="flex min-h-full items-end justify-center p-4 sm:items-center">
       <div class="w-full max-w-2xl bg-white dark:bg-black rounded-lg shadow-xl">
         <!-- Header -->
         <div class="px-6 py-4 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-white/10">
           <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Edit User Profile</h2>
         </div>
         
         <!-- Content -->
         <div class="px-6 py-4 space-y-6">

           <button @click="closeModal" 
                   class="text-black/70 dark:text-white/70 hover:text-black dark:hover:text-white">
             Cancel
           </button>
           <div class="space-x-2">

                     class="text-red-600 hover:text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 dark:hover:text-red-300">
               Delete User
             </button>
             <button type="submit" 
                     class="bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700">
               Save Changes

**Security Considerations**:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Only users with admin role (role_id === 1) can access these features
   - Middleware protection on all admin routes
   - Server-side validation of admin status

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Validate all input data
   - Sanitize output to prevent XSS
   - Confirm destructive actions
   - Log all admin actions for audit

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Proper error logging
   - Fallback UI states

**Testing Requirements**:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Component rendering
   - Form validation
   - State management
   - API integration

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - User flow testing
   - Role management
   - Delete user flow
   - Error scenarios

3. **E2E Tests**:
   - Complete user management workflow
   - Dark/light mode testing
   - Responsive design testing

This user management system should provide administrators with a powerful yet intuitive interface for managing platform users while maintaining security and data integrity.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
* Handle up to 500 concurrent users with minimal latency (Supabase + serverless approach)

### 5.2 Scalability
* Potential for incremental growth; code structure should allow expansions in features

### 5.3 Security
* Enforce role-based access (admin, coach, member)
* SSL for all transactions, secure Stripe integration
* Supabase RLS for data protection

### 5.4 Branding & Theming
* Default: black/white styling with optional accent color
* Light/Dark mode toggle

## 6. Risks & Considerations

* **Payment Integration Complexity**: Ensure secure handling of Stripe and compliance with relevant regulations
* **Content Moderation**: Potential need for automated or manual filtering of inappropriate content
* **Push Notifications**: Requires additional service (Firebase, OneSignal, etc.). Evaluate in Phase 3
* **Timeline & Scope**: Must prioritize MVP features to release early

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Technical Architecture Planning**: Diagram how Nuxt 3, Supabase, and Stripe will interact
2. **UI/UX Prototyping**: Create wireframes for landing page, Threads, and Admin Dashboard
3. **MVP Build (Phase 1)**: Landing, Auth, Threads, Basic Admin tools
4. **Phase 2**: Catalog & Stripe
5. **Phase 3**: Advanced analytics, push notifications, expanded admin features
